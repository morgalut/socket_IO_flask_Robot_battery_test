### Project Overview

The **Energy Monitoring Dashboard** aims to provide real-time insights into the energy consumption of a fleet of autonomous robots. This project will help in monitoring the operational efficiency of these robots, managing their energy usage, and ensuring they remain functional without running out of power.

### Project Structure

Here's a breakdown of the project structure, along with a description of each file's role:

```
energy_dashboard/
├── app/
│ ├── __init__.py
│ ├── models.py
│ ├── enums.py
│ ├── services.py
│ ├── routes.py
├── config.py
├── run.py
└── requirements.txt
```

### File Descriptions

1. **`app/__init__.py`**:
 - This file initializes the Flask application and sets up the application context.
 - It usually imports the necessary modules, initializes extensions (like database connections), and registers blueprints (if applicable).

2. **`app/models.py`**:
 - This file contains the data models for the application.
 - You will define classes that represent the `Robot` and its attributes (like `battery_level`, `state`, etc.).
 - If you use a database (like SQLAlchemy), this is where you define the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) models to interact with your database.

3. **`app/enums.py`**:
 - This file defines the enumerations (enums) that categorize various states and actions within the application.
 - For instance, the `RobotState` enum can define possible states of a robot (like `ACTIVE`, `CHARGING`, and `IDLE`), allowing for better readability and maintainability of your code.

4. **`app/services.py`**:
 - This file contains the business logic for managing the fleet of robots.
 - It includes functions for calculating the overall fleet status (e.g., total robots, active robots, battery health) and simulating energy consumption.
 - Services can be seen as the layer where the application processes data and performs operations without directly interacting with the request/response cycle.

5. **`app/routes.py`**:
 - This file defines the API endpoints for your application.
 - You will set up routes (e.g., `/status`, `/simulate`) that correspond to HTTP methods (GET, POST) to handle requests from the front end or other clients.
 - Each route typically calls functions from your service layer (defined in `services.py`) to get or manipulate data.

6. **`config.py`**:
 - This file holds the configuration settings for the Flask application.
 - It defines settings like the database URI, secret key, and debug mode.
 - Different configurations can be defined for development, testing, and production environments.

7. **`run.py`**:
 - This file serves as the entry point for your application.
 - It initializes the Flask application and runs the development server. This is where you can configure the app to run with specific settings and start listening for incoming requests.

8. **`requirements.txt`**:
 - This file lists all the dependencies and libraries needed for your project, including Flask and any other packages you are using (like NumPy, Pandas, etc.).
 - You can install all required packages in a virtual environment using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Functionality of the Project

- **Monitoring Fleet Status**: The dashboard will allow users to query the overall status of the robot fleet, including the number of active robots, those charging, and average battery health.

- **Simulating Energy Consumption**: The service will simulate how energy is consumed by the robots based on their activities and provide updated statuses in real-time.

- **Real-Time Data Handling**: Although the backend will handle the logic, the data will be sent to the frontend via APIs, which can utilize WebSocket or similar technologies for real-time updates (although not detailed in the current structure ).

### Conclusion

This project combines Python's Flask framework with OOP principles, allowing for organized, maintainable code that adheres to best practices. The design promotes separation of concerns, ensuring that models, services, and routes are distinct and focused on their responsibilities. This makes it easier to expand the project in the future, whether by adding more features or integrating with a frontend application for visualization and interaction.
